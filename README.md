cocoaheads-accessiblity-samplecode
===================================

# About
This is the presentation and the sample code discussed in my presentation on "Accessiblity for Custom Views” for the March 2013 CocoaHeads Stockholm meet up. 

The code is intendet to show how to give accessible behavior to custom views and view controllers. As an example custom view controller, a swipe gesture based split view was implemented and then made accessible. 

# Know defects
The focues on the project is accesisbliy so there are plenty of things missing. One very obvious is that the code only looks good in Portrait and doesn’t support other orientatitions. 

# License 
All sample code is put under MIT license to help spread the accessiblity. 

The project includes one method from [this answer by Dave DeLong’s on StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/a/3805354/608157).

The project also lincudes a list of color names from [“Name that Color”](http://chir.ag/projects/ntc/) originally from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_colors), [Crayola](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Crayola_crayon_colors), and [Color-Name Dictionaries](http://people.csail.mit.edu/jaffer/Color/Dictionaries.html). Name that Color is licensed under Creative Commons so that license also applies to the list of color names included in this sample project.
